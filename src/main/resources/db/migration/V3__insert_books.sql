('Twisted Tales','Annette de Jonge','2004-06-19',55,
'Many of the stories contained in this book began as exercises created in writing classes I attended. Each completed
story was submitted, accepted and broadcast over two community radio stations. One radio station was in Brisbane and
the other in Rockhampton at their interestingly named N.A.G. Radio Station. My understanding is that N.A.G is the
first initial of each of the owners of the radio station.
Our small writing group met once a week and we all took turns in hosting at our respective homes. There were only
ever eight of us because that is all the chairs that would fit around the dining tables.
At each gathering, a casual word for our exercise was selected from a dictionary and a random sentence taken from a
book. A time limit, usually of fifteen minutes was chosen to complete our project. Our story had to have the necessary
requirements of a story and at times ending we read out loud what we had created.
It was amazing to learn how the creative minds there had all started with the one word and sentence yet wrote
something completely different for their story.',

('The Hammer of God','Reginald Cook','2001-03-08',315,
'For centuries, deep inside the bowels of the church, hidden from all except a few, a hauntingly evil cancer has spread like a murderous plague, destroying everything and everyone in its path. No one is exempt from its lure, and it will go to the depths of hell to accomplish one single goal at all costs. Global domination through a new world order. This cancer has a name: The Order of Asmodeus.

Under a binding cloak of secrecy, a brother and sisterhood of handpicked servants have been chasing down The Order of Asmodeus for as long as the demonic sect has existed. Their mandate, root out the cancer and destroy it at every turn. Their name? Il Martello di Dio. The Hammer of God.',

('Mike Australia','Mike Dixon','2016-03-16',46,
'Some call it the world''s smallest continent. Others say it''s the world''s largest island. Either way, Australia is BIG. The distance from Perth to Cairns is about 3,500 km (2,000 miles), which is roughly the same as Gibraltar to St Petersburg, Vancouver to New Orleans or Tokyo to Hanoi. Australia is almost exactly the same size as the USA (minus Alaska) but has only 23 million people to America''s 300 million. Apart from the coastal fringes, it is a dry sun-baked land. The south has a temperate (sometimes cold) climate and the top third is in the tropics. A range of mountains runs down the east coast. Rain falls on the seaward side and this is where the bulk of the population lives. Further areas of habitation are to be found in soggy Tasmania, around Adelaide and in the vicinity of Perth. The rest of the continent is sparsely populated. There''s more in the book, lots more!',

'Religion is to be found whenever anyone contemplates Mystery. By "Mystery" with an upper-case "M" I do not mean mere problems like proving Fermat''s Last Theorem or discovering the nature of dark energy or discovering a latter-day Rosetta Stone that would enable one to translate a previously unknown language.
Such questions are all, in principle, answerable, given the requisite tools and theories.
Rather, by "Mystery" I mean Questions with an upper-case "Q" that have never been answered, and that probably can never be answered, even in theory, no matter how sophisticated our technology or subtle our theories. Questions like "Is there a God?", "What happens to human beings after death?", "What principle should we follow for ethical guidance in the decisions we make?", and "Does human life have an ultimate Meaning, and if so, what is it?"',

We want to find out what happens next and what the main characters do and what they say to each other.
We may feel excited, sad, afraid, angry or really happy.
This is because the experience of reading or listening to a story is much more likely to make us ''feel'' that we are part of the story, too.
Just like in our ''real'' lives, we might love or hate different characters in the story.
Perhaps we recognise ourselves or others in some of them. Perhaps we have similar problems.',
